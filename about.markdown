I'm an 18 year old roblox developer from Tunisia, I have over 3 years worth of scripting experience on roblox focused mainly on my own works.

I'm looking to branch out and work with other people!

Payment is negotiable but must be fixed and not percentage based.

I will always do my best to satisfy consumer needs and wants, and willing to be flexible with how I work and the scripts I provide.

Feel free to check out my [Portfolio](..)
